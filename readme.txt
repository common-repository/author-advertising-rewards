== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I want to use Adsense as my advertising program? =

You modify the Author Page and let your users know that you're using Adsense. You check one of the custom fields and give it the title of Adsense Slot ID or something similar. Then the author will put their publisher ID and slot ID information into their page. Remember to put your own defaults in the custom default slots so that your own ads show properly.

= Can I use this for more than just advertising? =

Yes you can put any HTML code into the boxes. PHP won't work though. You could use this plugin to insert a widget that displays the author's picture or some other author information. It'll still rotate with your information unless you set your admin percentage to 0% then it'll just be for authors. On the front page if you randomise ads then all of your author's information/picture etc would be rotated.

= Is this plugin compatible with WordPress 2.7?

Yes it is.

This plugin was based on the author-advertising-plugin by Harley Quine but all of the code is entirely new.
